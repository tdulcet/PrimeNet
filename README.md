# AutoPrimeNet
The PrimeNet automated assignment handler program for GIMPS

Copyright © 2024 Teal Dulcet

Automatically gets and registers assignments, reports assignment progress and results, uploads proof files to and downloads certification starting values from PrimeNet for the Mlucas, GpuOwl/PRPLL, CUDALucas, mfaktc and mfakto GIMPS programs. Additionally, it can get assignments and report results to mersenne.ca for exponents above the PrimeNet limit of 1G. Supports both Python 2 and 3 and Windows, macOS and Linux. Requires the [Requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is included with most Python 3 installations. The program will automatically prompt to install Requests on first run if it is not already installed.

Adapted from the PrimeNet Python script from [Mlucas](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html#download2) by [Loïc Le Loarer](https://github.com/llloic11/primenet) and Ernst W. Mayer, which itself was adapted from primetools by [Mark Rose](https://github.com/MarkRose/primetools) and [teknohog](https://github.com/teknohog/primetools).

AutoPrimeNet (the PrimeNet program) was moved from the [Distributed Computing Scripts](https://github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts#primenet) repository.

## Usage

```
Usage: autoprimenet.py [options]
Use -h/--help to see all options
Use --setup to configure this instance of the program

This program will automatically get and register assignments, report
assignment progress and results, upload proof files to and download
certification starting values from PrimeNet for the Mlucas, GpuOwl/PRPLL,
CUDALucas, mfaktc and mfakto GIMPS programs. It can get assignments and report
results to mersenne.ca for exponents above the PrimeNet limit of 1G. It also
saves its configuration to a 'prime.ini' file by default, so it is only
necessary to give most of the arguments once. The first time it is run, it
will register the current Mlucas/GpuOwl/PRPLL/CUDALucas/mfaktc/mfakto instance
with PrimeNet (see the Registering Options below). Then, it will report
assignment results, get assignments and upload any proof files to PrimeNet on
the --timeout interval, or only once if --timeout is 0. It will additionally
report the progress on the --checkin interval.

                        Number of workers (CPU Cores/GPUs), Default: 1
  -c CPU, --cpu-num=CPU
                        CPU core or GPU number to get assignments for,
                        Default: 0. Deprecated in favor of the --dir option.
  -n NUM_CACHE, --num-cache=NUM_CACHE
                        Number of assignments to cache, Default: 0. Deprecated
                        in favor of the --days-work option.
  -W DAYS_OF_WORK, --days-work=DAYS_OF_WORK
                        Days of work to queue ((0-180] days), Default: 1 day
                        for mfaktc/mfakto or 3 days otherwise. Increases
                        num_cache when the time left for all assignments is
                        less than this number of days.
  --force-pminus1=TESTS_SAVED
                        Force P-1 factoring before LL/PRP tests and/or change
                        the default PrimeNet PRP and P-1 tests_saved value.
  --pminus1-threshold=PM1_MULTIPLIER
                        Retry the P-1 factoring before LL/PRP tests only if
                        the existing P-1 bounds are less than the target
                        bounds (as listed on mersenne.ca) times this
                        threshold/multiplier. Requires the --force-pminus1
                        option.
  --force-pminus1-bounds=PM1_BOUNDS
                        Force using the 'MIN', 'MID' or 'MAX' optimal P-1
                        bounds (as listed on mersenne.ca) for P-1 tests. For
                        Mlucas, this will rewrite Pfactor= assignments to
                        Pminus1=. For GpuOwl, this will use a nonstandard
                        Pfactor= format to add the bounds. Can be used in
                        combination with the --force-pminus1 option.
  --convert-ll-to-prp   Convert all LL assignments to PRP. This is for use
                        when registering assignments.
  --convert-prp-to-ll   Convert all PRP assignments to LL. This is
                        automatically enabled for first time PRP assignments
                        when the --workpref option is for a first time LL
                        worktype.
  --no-report-100m      Do not report any prime results for exponents greater
                        than or equal to 100 million digits. You must setup
                        another method to notify yourself, such as setting the
                        notification options below.
  --checkin=HOURS_BETWEEN_CHECKINS
                        Hours to wait between sending assignment progress and
                        expected completion dates (1-168 hours), Default: 1
                        hours.
  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout=TIMEOUT
                        Seconds to wait between updates, Default: 3600 seconds
                        (1 hour). Users with slower internet may want to set a
                        larger value to give time for any PRP proof files to
                        upload. Use 0 to update once and exit.
  -s, --status          Output a status report and any expected completion
                        dates for all assignments and exit.
  --upload-proofs       Report assignment results, upload all PRP proofs and
                        exit. Requires PrimeNet User ID.
  --recover             Report assignment results, recover all assignments and
                        exit. This will overwrite any existing work files.
  --recover-all         The same as --recover, except for PrimeNet it will
                        additionally recover expired assignments and for
                        mersenne.ca it will recover all assignments for all
                        systems/workers to the first worker. This will
                        overwrite any existing work files.
  --register-exponents  Prompt for all parameters needed to register one or
                        more specific exponents and exit.
  --unreserve=EXPONENT  Unreserve the exponent and exit. Use this only if you
                        are sure you will not be finishing this exponent.
  --unreserve-all       Report assignment results, unreserve all assignments
                        and exit.
  --no-more-work        Prevent this program from getting new assignments and
                        exit.
  --resume-work         Resume getting new assignments after having previously
                        run the --no-more-work option and exit.
  --ping                Ping the PrimeNet server, show version information and
                        exit.
  --no-color            Do not use color in output.
  --setup               Prompt for all the options that are needed to setup
                        this program and exit.

  Registering Options:
    Sent to PrimeNet/GIMPS when registering. It will automatically send
    the progress, which allows the program to then be monitored on the
    GIMPS website CPUs page (https://www.mersenne.org/cpus/), just like
    with Prime95/MPrime. This also allows the program to get much smaller
    Category 0 and 1 exponents, if it meets the other requirements
    (https://www.mersenne.org/thresholds/).

                        more for hyperthreaded.
    --hours=CPU_HOURS   Hours per day you expect the GIMPS program will run (1
                        - 24), Default: 24 hours. Used to give better
                        estimated completion dates.

  Notification Options:
    Optionally configure this program to automatically send an e-mail/text
    message notification if there is an error, if the GIMPS program has
    stalled, if the available disk space is low or if it found a new
    Mersenne prime. Send text messages by using your mobile providers
    e-mail to SMS or MMS gateway. Use the --test-email option to verify
    the configuration.
